I am a Computer science major at Cal State Fullerton, expecting to graduate in 2027. I hope to become a software engineer, learning full stack.

# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs.

Lab 6 Part 2

This lab was the first lab that I enjoyed. Till then every lab had been a little easy but this one made me work a little harder. I enjoyed creating and using functions to be used in the main blackjack.cc file. I also enjoyed using complex if statements. This lab caused me to break my head making variables and thinking of the different scenarios in blackjack, looking back its quite simple but it was my first hard coding assignment. 

Lab 7 Part 2

I enjoyed this lab because I was the first to finish it in my class. This assignment was less complex and more tedious. The constant spelling of the street names and the times needed for each street name took forever. Having different variables and times that needed to be mixed together got confusing but it taught me how to be patient with coding. I love coding, especially for real world examples like the parking code. 

Lab 12

This code was the most complex code so far. I loved learning about how images work, how the colors work, and how to code an image. I hope to code in my future careers and this lab was eye opening to see the work it takes to code a simple gif with the different colored images. I hope to work on web design as well so I am very happy I finished with a lab like this one.
